# Real Estate

#### Input and receive real estate data using a Java-programmed graphical user interface.

This program demonstrates proficiency in data structures, class integration, inheritence, exception handling, and more, all presented to the user in a GUI with numerous elements. Showcasing management of class relations, each of the 5 properties (all extending the "Property" class) contain their own unique fields. Additionally, geographical areas can be added and hence become an option for the "geographical area" field in each property. Finally, properties can be purchased by clicking the "Purchase" button and selecting multiple properties' checkboxes.
